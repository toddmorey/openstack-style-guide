The purpose of this section is to explain how to write about OpenStack in consistent way that demonstrates our brand’s and community’s personality.

## Our voice is...

**Knowledgeable—**We aim for mastery in what we do, but we also recognize that improvement is ongoing.

**Friendly—**We’re open to new users, contributors, and ideas. We welcome questions and debate. We embrace diversity.

**Global—**We realize that not everyone thinks the same way. We avoid geographic-specific colloquialisms and slang that can confuse the meaning of things. We avoid regional references, such as seasons (because they vary by hemisphere) and times of day (preferring UTC as the standard time reference).

**Accessible—**We strive for simple language to make OpenStack content and documentation accessible to non-native English speakers. We work to translate into many languages, and we create systems for greater participation.

**Passionate—**We believe cloud technology is changing the world, and the people behind it do so with purpose, ambition, and excitement. We welcome and foster passion for a great cause.
