## Do:
* Ensure you have permission to use the logo. For a commercial trademark, that means a signed and current commercial trademark license agreement. For a user group, that means a certification from an ambassador that your group has met the criteria to be an official OpenStack User Group.
* Ensure the logo dimensions are preserved if the logo is scaled (include ratio dimensions here, and an ideal pixel size)
* Ensure the logo color is true to brand guidelines (note primary red PMS here)


## Donâ€™t:
* Alter the logo in any way
* Stretch the logo
* Print on a busy or brightly colored background
* Use a social media badge in lieu of the logo
* Use the logo as a social media badge
* Remove any part of the logo, such as the words or trademark symbol
* Recolor the logo
* Modify the logo to stand for another program or entity (e.g. to stand for a project, program, or group)
