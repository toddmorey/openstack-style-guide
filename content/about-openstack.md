    OpenStack is the de-facto standard for private clouds and is also available as a service via dozens of public cloud providers around the world.
    </p>
    <p>
    At itâ€™s core, OpenStack is an open source integration engine that provides APIs to orchestrate bare metal, virtual machine and container resources on a single network. The same OpenStack code powers a global network of public and private clouds, backed by the largest ecosystem of technology providers, to enable cost savings, control and portability.
    </p>
    <p>
    OpenStack is a global community of more than 60,000 individuals across 180 countries supported by the OpenStack Foundation, which facilitates the development of many innovative projects in the open infrastructure space. The community delivers two software releases each year, which are Apache 2 licensed and productized by a large ecosystem of technology vendors in our Marketplace.
